I expect to the first menu page to render when the component loads.

I expect a new menu page to render when a category is clicked.

I expect the menu to expand when "view full menu" is clicked.

I expect the menu to shrink once more when "collapse menu" is clicked.

I expect category borders to highlight when the menu is clicked.

I expect nothing to change when the current category is clicked.

I expect specials to render beneath the menu.
